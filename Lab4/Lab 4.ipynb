It has a solid reputation in Malaysia, especially in energy-related fields. The negative part is the facilities such as the swimming pool are close since my first year till 3 year now and there are limited parking so it's make hard to find.  \n",

Personally for the negative side I would say that UNITEN needs to fix the broken toilet in the library and BM/BN buildings  \n",

What attracted me to UNITEN in the first place is not there anymore, e.g; our very own faculty building. The student dedicated website is terrible. I can name thousands of thousands website that is infinitely better. The hostel room application is ridiculous. The only pros that I could ever think of is the location of the campus that is situated near to major cities.  \n",

However, its specialized focus and location may not suit everyone. If you’re looking for a university with a strong technical emphasis and ties to the energy sector, UNITEN could be a great fit. If you prefer a more diverse academic environment or a bustling social scene, you might want to explore other options.  \n",

It is practically 10 times the price of a normal public university with barely any additional service. Most service center is broken, some road light doesn't even lit up and certain buildings are either close or straight up close off making the layout of the campus make less and less sense throughout the year. The service quality also isn't much better than the local ones therefore making the price tags makes less sense. The management side also isn't a huge downside. Schedule are a mess, events handled in exchange of student comfort and the report system keep making us report the same thing over and over again instead of putting on a timer or weight to solve the solution. Overall, 10/10, will never do this again.  \n",

The course selection is abundance and align with modern world. Then, their proximity to bunch of food is very convenient. That what I could deem positive part about it. For neutral part of it, is their facilities, there are some good like the classes especially the new renovated class at BM, then we found poor class such as BV Theatre, then we have Library which is such a good benchmark for other theatre. The road is serviceable. Then for bad part is their management, slow, frustrating and could be very annoying. The event are subpar at best, the SRC is barely noticeable. In general, bunch of Uniten features, they are towards the right direction but lacking at execution.   \n",

First for the longest times, the walkway for students and the bike road are damaged and filled with holes which will cause accidents and other issues. another is the issue with the admins in UNITEN UCC. although there are many whom help with the issue.

Many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. The library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger Wi-Fi connection. Additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.\\n\\nThe university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. Response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. Course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. Moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure UNITEN remains a top choice for higher education.\\n  \n",

Uniten got its good and bad side in it. Good things are the lecturers, environment, and education here are positive and non-toxic. Its quite peaceful here. The bad side are more on how the projection of the student's future and well-being. I've seen that the staff's and how uniten goes is not student-oriented. The courses are kinda old for certain subjects and not industry based. We also lack of business and entrepreneur funding for startups. We dont have the innovation, research, and startups environment here. If the environments are more competitive, and the uniten itself promotes the innovation and research culture, we could produce better future oriented students. Exposure is a guaranteed for them. But I believe jt requires both efforts from students and the uniten also. We good  \n",

Nighttime is the time where all to most students are occupied with studying, assignments or even resting since in the daytime, most of the students wouldnt be able to do so because of classes. I think nighttime classes should not exist.  \n",

I loved the education. The syllabus taught to students are very comprehensive and up to date to the industry standard. This prepares students in the working industry when they graduate.\\n\\nAs for the facilities, its quite poor in quality. Example includes, roof leakage, broken toilet and damaged roads. There is also poor security controls. Anybody can enter in and out of UNITEN whether they are a student or complete stranger. This poses a threat to all of UNITEN community from students to staffs. \\n\\nWould i recommend this university to someone i know? No i would not. There are other universities out there that are miles better than UNITEN. Make a proper research about the university before you enroll because you are going to spend 3-4 years there and potentially have a bright future ahead waiting for you.   \n",

The food here is amazing and affordable. The accomodation for the student is nice but the problem is always the internet not being able to connect to wifi sometimes. Other then that, parking need to be improve so that more student can park their car.  \n",

There are some aspects that I like such as the courses & syllabuses taught to us students. They are relevant for our future because I’ve used those knowledge during my internship and they were shocked that I know such things. The environment itself is also not bad. Library is comfortable. Classes have full lightings to study in. What I dont like is the lack of concerns towards students’ practicality. Less parking spots.

      "23    uniten has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. the library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger wi-fi connection. additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.\\n\\nthe university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure uniten remains a top choice for higher education.\\n\n",

      "23    uniten has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. the library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger wi-fi connection. additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.\\n\\nthe university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure uniten remains a top choice for higher education.\\n\n",

      "23    uniten has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. the library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger wi-fi connection. additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.\\n\\nthe university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure uniten remains a top choice for higher education.\\n\n",

      "23    uniten has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. the library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger wi-fi connection. additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.\\n\\nthe university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure uniten remains a top choice for higher education.\\n\n",

      "23    uniten has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. the library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger wi-fi connection. additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.\\n\\nthe university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure uniten remains a top choice for higher education.\\n\n",
